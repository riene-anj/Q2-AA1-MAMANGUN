			<h1>WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 2023?</h1>
			<h4 style="text-align: left;">PHILIPPINES</h4>
				<li style="text-align: left;">Scarborough is part of the West Philippine Sea</li>
				<li style="text-align: left;">This area is visited by Philippine fishing vessels for resources and food</li>				
				<li style="text-align: left;">This area is rich in corals and natural resources. Thus, this area is really helpful to the Filipinos</li>
				<li style="text-align: left;">Warns Chinese vessels that they should not cross the area.</li>	
				
				<h4 style="text-align: left;">CHINA</h4>
				<li style="text-align: left;">Claims that this area is part of their territory. They base this with a historial map.</li>
				<li style="text-align: left;">Warns Philippine vessels that they should not cross the area they are claiming</li>
				<li style="text-align: left;">Uses the resources and puts the ecosystem at harm</li>
				

				
				<p style="text-align: left;">They basically both have such claims of territory in this area. Thus, disagreements from both parties.</p>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Please use the picture (FROM CNN) from the left as a basis. As you can see, the picture exhibits the map containing the Philippine waters and those surrounding it. The red line is what China claims its territory is (9-dash-line). While the white line depicts the Philippine Territorial region. The yellow lines on the other hand correspond to the EEZ or Exclusive Economic Zone of the Philippines. What does the Exclusive Economic Zone mean? What is its significance?

					Well the EEZ corresponds to the 200 nautical-mile regions from the territory itself. The country claims legal rights for it since this area is the West Philippine Sea...leading to the ability to use its resources. 

					Since our EEZ is within China's 9-dash-line, both parties claim over the territory since the area of ownership clashes as seen in this map.</p>

			<p>It's very clear that China does not want to let go of claiming our territory. After all, the West Philippine Sea IS VERYY RICH in resources. I am very much sure na yun yung habol ng China :(</p>
